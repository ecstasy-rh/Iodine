A build of Silverblue leveraging [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) to provide an immutable experience appropriate for chromebooks. It utilizes technology such as: [Keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd), [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux), and bits and pieces of [TyrianOS.](https://github.com/Icycoide/TyrianOS/)

Very WIP, installation instructions coming soon.
